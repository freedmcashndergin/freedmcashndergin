Have you bought a new car recently? There are numerous creditors, bankers and car dealership funding advertisements the past few months. It seems that car loans are one of the new lucrative businesses for people credit challenged people. That's right; folks may have sub-prime credit scores but are still being offered car loans. Online direct payday loan lenders are not the only service willing to help those in need. In similar format, these car loan lenders are providing this service at much higher rates than typical car loans. Just because you receive an offer to apply for a car loan, it doesn't mean you have to apply and it surely does not mean you should use the whole limit offered, that is if you actually get approved.

Offers do not equate approved money. They are a way to get new customers through the door. When an online payday loans direct lender advertises, they are considered predatory, but when the loan is for a car, it is all good, right? Not really, but the industry standards for lending services are not the same. Creditors can drum up new customers much in the save way a bank could. When you go to a car dealership and they have their own funding service, credit challenged folks are more than welcome.
